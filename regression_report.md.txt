# Regression Analysis Report

## Introduction
This project uses the `mtcars` dataset to study the relationship between **Car Weight (`wt`)** and **Miles per Gallon (`mpg`)**.  
The goal is to determine whether heavier cars consume more fuel.

---

## Code
The complete R script is available in [regression_analysis.R](regression_analysis.R).

## Output

### ðŸ”¹ Model Summary
- Intercept = **37.29**
- Slope (wt) = **-5.34**
- RÂ² = **0.75** (strong fit)
- p-value < **0.001** (significant)

### ðŸ”¹ Correlation
`cor(mpg, wt) = -0.8677` â†’ strong negative correlation.

### ðŸ”¹ Visualization
The plot shows a **negative linear relationship** between car weight and MPG.
